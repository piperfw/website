Summary: Review of our "Deploying a Web App with Kubernetes: A Beginner's Guide" workshop at RSECon25


At  RSECon25 in Warwick, Cloud Native SIG ran our opening event, a workshop for people looking to get started with Kubernetes. It was a success, with a packed out room and a separate pod of conference attendees following the workshop online, we certainly managed to scale our workshop appropriately! We received a lot of positive feedback and exciting contributions from participants. If you did not manage to attend or are looking for further reading please visit [rosalindfranklininstitute.github.io/rsecon25-intro-to-kubernetes/](https://rosalindfranklininstitute.github.io/rsecon25-intro-to-kubernetes/)
where you can see the tutorial in its entirety. A big thanks to Alex Lubbock for the Kubechaos App and Lewis Sampson and Piper Fowler Wright for the content and teaching.

The event was enjoyed by 80 people, and included material on Kubernetes architecture, Helm and practical examples for deploying your applications robustly and scalably. There was lots of great developer energy and support in the room and we fixed all manner of technical bugs and got some excellent contributions both to the course material and to our Kubechaos App, which we are currently reviewing. There are some really creative Javascript developers in the RSE community.

We had lots of positive feedback highlighting the workshop’s impact in the community. Wahab Kawafi from the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing shared this endorsement, "with cloud native workflows gaining popularity with researchers, it's great to finally have a resource to upskill RSEs in using Kubernetes and Helm". To continue this support, we have made the course open source and plan to do further events exploring other areas of Kubernetes.
