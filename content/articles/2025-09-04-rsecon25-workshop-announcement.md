Summary: Join us at RSECon25 for an introductory workshop on Kubernetes!

It has been a bit quiet from us over the past months as we are trying to start the SIG. We are delighted to announce that we have our first Cloud-Native SIG lead activity, a workshop at RSECon25 on Thursday 11th September.

This workshop focusses on introducing some Kubernetes basic with our fun app Kubechaos (credit to Alex Lubbock). If you are attending RSECon25 and are interested in getting started with Kubernetes please come along to the workshop. There are a few prerequisites you need which you can see here: [prerequisites](https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/rsecon25-intro-to-kubernetes?tab=readme-ov-file#-prerequisites).

If you can't make the workshop, you are always welcome to follow our tutorial at [rsecon25-intro-to-kubernetes](https://rosalindfranklininstitute.github.io/rsecon25-intro-to-kubernetes/).
